  <h1>Man-in-the-middle attack:</h1>
  <br />
  <h3>
      A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker intercepts communication between two parties to eavesdrop, steal data, or manipulate the exchange.<br><br>

      In a MitM attack, the attacker positions themselves between the two parties and intercepts communication to steal data or modify it before passing it on to the recipient. The attacker can use various techniques to carry out the attack, such as ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, or SSL stripping.<br><br>
      
      Once the attacker is positioned between the two parties, they can intercept sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card information, or other personal data that is being transmitted. They can also modify the communication, such as redirecting the victim to a fake website to steal their login credentials or installing malware on their device.<br><br>
      
      MitM attacks can occur in various scenarios, such as public Wi-Fi networks, unsecured websites, or compromised routers. Attackers can use these vulnerabilities to intercept and manipulate communication between two parties.<br><br>
      
      To prevent MitM attacks, here are some best practices you can follow:<br><br>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Use encrypted communication protocols such as HTTPS or SSL/TLS to secure communication between two parties. This ensures that the communication is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by attackers.</li>
        <li>Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks or unsecured websites to transmit sensitive information. Use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your communication and protect your data.</li>
        <li>Be cautious of phishing attacks that try to lure you into entering your sensitive information on a fake website. Always verify the URL and certificate of the website before entering sensitive information.</li>
        <li>Keep your software and firmware up to date to patch known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to carry out MitM attacks.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      By following these best practices, you can greatly reduce your risk of falling victim to a MitM attack and protect your personal and sensitive data.
