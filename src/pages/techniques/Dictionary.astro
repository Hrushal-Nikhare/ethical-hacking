  <h1>Dictionary Attack:</h1>
  <br />
  <h3>
      A dictionary attack is a type of cyber attack where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system or account by systematically trying a large number of words or phrases from a dictionary. The idea behind a dictionary attack is that many users choose passwords that are based on common words or phrases, making it easier for an attacker to guess their password using a dictionary.<br><br>
  
      To carry out a dictionary attack, the attacker uses a program or script that automates the process of trying words or phrases from a dictionary as passwords. The program will typically try different variations of each word or phrase, such as adding numbers or symbols, to increase the likelihood of guessing the correct password.<br><br>
  
      Dictionary attacks are a common type of attack against password-protected systems, such as online accounts or computer systems. They are often used in combination with other attacks, such as phishing or social engineering, to gain access to sensitive information.<br><br>
  
      To protect yourself from a dictionary attack, it is important to choose a strong, complex password that is not based on common words or phrases. This means using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoiding easily guessable information such as your name, birthdate, or favorite sports team.<br><br>
  
      Additionally, many systems and websites now implement security measures such as two-factor authentication, which can help prevent unauthorized access even if an attacker manages to guess your password. Two-factor authentication requires an additional form of authentication, such as a security token or biometric information, in addition to your password.<br><br>
